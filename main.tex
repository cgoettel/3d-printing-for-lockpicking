% sections on:
%     -book, chapter, verse page flow
%         -\markboth{}{} problems with chapters and verses starting a page
%         -stopped using \section and instead defined a new macro which would (1) properly display the chapter number in relation to the chapter header and (2) defined \markboth{chapter:1}{chapter:1} to force the first verse to show in the header. This solved the issue of having a new chapter start a page, but there is still a problem with verses starting the page because the previous and current page do not recognize the correct verse.
